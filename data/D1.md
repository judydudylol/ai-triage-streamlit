# 1. Project Overview

This prototype serves as an **intelligent decision-making engine** for emergency medical dispatch in the **Al Ghadir neighborhood, Riyadh**. The goal is to determine the fastest and safest response method—**Ground Ambulance** or **Medical eVTOL (Doctor Drone)**—to reach a patient at **7319 Al Humaid St**.

## 2. Decision Logic (The "Dispatch Brain")

The AI must process three primary variables to output a dispatch command:

### A. Safety Filter (Weather)
*   **Constraint:** Drones cannot operate in high winds or low visibility (sandstorms).
*   **Rule:** If `weather_risk > 35%`, the system must default to **Ambulance**, regardless of speed advantage.

### B. Life-Saving Window (Medical Threshold)
*   **Rule:** If `predicted_ground_ETA > harm_threshold_mins`, the system triggers an **Emergency Drone Override**.

### C. Efficiency Optimization (Traffic)
*   **Constraint:** High-density traffic on the Northern Ring Road.
*   **Rule:** If `(ground_ETA - air_ETA) > 10 minutes`, dispatch the **Doctor Drone** to optimize urban resource allocation.

## 3. Geographical Constants: Al Ghadir

To calibrate the simulation, use these neighborhood-specific values:

*   **Target Coordinates:** 24.7745° N, 46.6575° E (Al Humaid St).
*   **Distance Ratio:** Ground routes are approximately **1.5x** the aerial distance due to Al Ghadir's road layout.
    *   Ground Distance: **4.8 km**
    *   Air Distance: **3.2 km**
*   **Speed Constants:**
    *   `Ambulance_Base_Speed`: **35 km/h** (weighted for siren-assisted navigation).
    *   `Drone_Cruise_Speed`: **120 km/h** (constant).

## 4. Data Schema

Files are attached containing the following:

1.  The scenarios selected.
2.  Medical situations.
3.  Examples of how the AI model should decide whether to send a drone or ambulance, and the places the drone can land in.
